# SF643D_Tools
A Collection of tools for viewing and potentially modifying data from SF643D.

# GDBtoJSON.py
Converts an input GDB file to a json file for easier viewing.
Usage: `GDBtoJSON.py *.*gdb`

# GDB_BINtoOBJ.py
Converts a modelgdb modelbin pair to obj. Likely won't work for every model atm as vertex type reading and data type reading isn't fully supported as of now.
Usage: `GDB_BINtoOBJ.py *.modelgdb`
